# MiniME - Support

In general I don't provide direct one on one support for MiniME. There
are however several places where you can get help:

* If you simply have a question about it's usage, try posting a question on [stackoverflow.com](http://www.stackoverflow.com).

* If you need an answer or a fix immediately, the [source code](implementation.md) code is available.

* If you're really stuck, you can [contact me](http://www.toptensoftware.com/contact) and I might get back to you.
